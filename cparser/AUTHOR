It probably wouldn't be where it is now without all the bugfixes, new features
and general support by:

Christoph Mallon   (he understands the standard :), bugfixes,
                    diagnostic infrastructure and printf format checker,
                    warnings)
Michael Beck       (bugfixes, firm optimization driver, warnings, comments)
