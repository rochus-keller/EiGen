This is cparser as provided at https://github.com/libfirm/cparser/, downloaded 
commit 51b173e from Nov. 2023, accessed 2024-07-10.

Did the following modifications:

- deactivated system include path
- removed Firm IR generator
- stubbed everything from Firm still required by cparse
- replaced ast2ir by codegen.cpp which generates Eigen IR (instead of libfirm)


cparser (in contrast to chibicc) can out of the box compile the Awfy C code
generated by the Oberon+ compiler, and it generally doesn't make the
impression of a toy compiler, but rather a robust, proven implementation
with a significant test suite. It is therefore worth considering as an
ECS frontend.
