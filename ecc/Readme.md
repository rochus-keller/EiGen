## ECC: Eigen C Compiler

ECC is a small C compiler derived from [chibicc](https://github.com/rui314/chibicc) (commit 90d1f7f from Dec 7, 2020, see README_ORIG.md for more information about chibicc).

Like chibicc, the compiler implements most of C99 and C11, but generates ECS IR (as specified [here](https://ecs.openbrace.org/manual/manualch23.html#x139-77200023)) instead of AMD64 assembler. There are also other differences to chibicc, e.g. that ECC runs on all platforms, not just on Unix/Linux. Thread-local and atomic variables, variable-length arrays and long doubles are not yet supported.

ECC is work in progress. The generated code is known to work on x86, x86_64, arma32 and arma64. There is a minimal implementation of the C runtime library used to run the testcases. The compiler is known to be compatible with e.g. SQLite or libpng, but not e.g. with the code generated by the [Oberon+ C99 code generator](https://github.com/rochus-keller/Oberon).

The compiler can be built using the BUSY build system (see https://github.com/rochus-keller/BUSY or https://github.com/rochus-keller/LeanCreator/).

When using the BUSY file of the outer directory, the compiler is integrated with codegens and linker, resulting in a standalone executable which only requires some of the obf files from the runtime directory of ECS (the latter to be referenced by the -L option).
