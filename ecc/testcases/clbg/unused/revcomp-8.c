// Copied the idea to use a lookup table for reverse complementing two
// characters at a time from roman blog's C++ program.

// Here's a high level overview of how this program works to help you better
// understand this code, the notation being used for variable/function names,
// and the comments. The main thread reads in sequences one at a time from
// standard input and when the end of a sequence is found (indicated by the
// start of another sequence or the end of input), one or more new threads are
// created to then fully process that sequence before the main thread continues
// reading any additional sequences. The sequence is split up into chunks of a
// modest size, the chunks are processed starting with the ones at the end of
// the sequence and proceeding to the ones at the front of the sequence, and
// multiple chunks can be processed in parallel. The processing of chunks is
// considered to be being handled in three steps, first a chunk gets assigned to
// a thread, then the chunk is reverse complemented, and finally the chunk is
// written. A little extra care needs to be taken with the last step in order to
// ensure that the chunks are being written in the correct order.
//
// There are also a few more additional noteworthy optimizations being used by
// this program. During the reverse complementing step, characters can be
// reversed complemented two at a time instead of one at a time by making use of
// a modestly sized lookup table that is quickly computed when first starting
// the program. Before reverse complementing chunks, the program checks to see
// if the sequence is an optimally sized one that consists of only full lines
// and if that is the case it allows a simpler/faster code path to be used to do
// the reverse complementing since it makes it unnecessary to move newlines
// around in the sequence. Finally to help minimize reading/writing to main
// memory and to reduce memory usage, instead of doing an in-place reverse
// complement of a sequence or creating a reversed complemented copy of the
// whole sequence, each thread writes reverse complemented chunks to a
// per-thread chunk sized area of memory (which will likely be cached) and then
// writes the reversed complemented chunks from there.


// This string/character array is used to convert characters into the
// complementing character. Note that some of the reverse complementing code
// also requires newlines to remain unchanged when complemented which is why the
// eleventh character is set to a newline.
#define COMPLEMENT_LOOKUP \
  "          \n                                                     "\

// While processing a sequence, the sequence is broken up into chunks which can
// be processed in parallel on computers with multiple CPU cores.
// LINES_PER_CHUNK will set the maximum amount of lines that are allowed in each
// chunk and consequently the maximum size of each chunk will be equal to
// LINES_PER_CHUNK*LINE_LENGTH bytes in size. Each thread will create an array
// on the stack that is large enough to contain these chunks so LINES_PER_CHUNK
// must be set small enough to allow this array to fit inside the stack. For
// best performance, this value should probably be set so that the maximum chunk
// size is somewhere between the L1 data cache size and
// 1/(2*NUMBER_OF_CPU_CORES) of the last level cache size (assuming each CPU
// core has its own L1 cache and the last level cache is shared between CPU
// cores).

// Since sequences can be broken up into chunks that can be processed in

// sequence_Characters_Left_To_Assign is self explanatory. Processing of the

// front_Character_Of_Last_Written_Chunk are used to separately keep track of
// the positions of the last assigned and written chunks. The chunks need to be
// written in the correct order after they are reverse complemented so threads
// may need to wait for other threads to finish writing their chunks first,
