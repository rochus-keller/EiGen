## ECC2: Eigen C Compiler 2

ECC2 is a C99 compiler derived from cparser
as provided at https://github.com/libfirm/cparser/, downloaded 
commit 51b173e from Nov. 2023, accessed 2024-07-10.

Did the following modifications:

- deactivated system include path
- removed Firm IR generator
- stubbed everything from Firm still required by cparser
- replaced ast2ir by codegen.cpp and backend.cpp which generate Eigen IR and then the object files and executable.

Cparser (in contrast to chibicc) can out of the box compile the Awfy C code
generated by the Oberon+ compiler, and it generally doesn't make the
impression of a toy compiler, but rather a robust, proven implementation
with a significant test suite. It is therefore well suited as an
ECS frontend. The generated code of the Cparser based ECC has also turned out to be two times faster than the 
code generated by the Chibicc based ECC, see the performance directory for more information.

The BUSY file of the outer directory builds a compiler integrated with codegens and linker, resulting in a standalone executable which only requires some of the obf files from the runtime directory (the latter to be referenced by the -L option).
