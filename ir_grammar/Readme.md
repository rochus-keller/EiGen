This is a grammar of the Eigen Intermediate Code as generated by the current Eigen compilers.
The grammar was derived from the descrption in the Eigen Compiler Suite user manual version
0.0.41, especially section 23. 

The manual describes the IR on instruction level; but there are instructions which together 
constitute a compound instruction. This compound is described in the text, but not 
reflected in the syntax definitions. The EBNF grammar included here considers these
compound instructions.

The grammar was used to generate a parser (using [EbnfStudio](https://github.com/rochus-keller/EbnfStudio)),
and this parser so far is able to read all cod files available (especially Hennessy and the Oberon-07 compiler).
